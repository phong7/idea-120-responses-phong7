I am not sure if it was just the games I decided to play, but all of the non-linear Twine games had to do with dying and creepy stuff. Lol - I really liked it. For my own Twine game, I'm fumbling with a couple ideas. Some of the instructions asks us to have a non-human or non-animal protagonist and to avoid making a life simulator. The only things that really comes to mind for a protagonist is either aliens, AI, or plants. While I think it's quite challenging thinking of a main character that isn't a human or animal, *challenge accepted*. The protagonist for my non-linear Twine game will either be a hive-mind intelligent life force or an AI. 

I'm not completely set on all the details, but in essence, I want to create a game around the a dystopia. So far, I'm thinking of a protagonist (most likely an AI) that is tasked to hunt humans on Earth and bring them to the "Mother", the ruling hive-mind entity. The setting of the place is "Pantopia", a city-state that is perfectly functioning and utopic in every way. As the game progresses, the player begins to learn that it's a utopia because people are integrated into the Mother hive-mind. Pantopia is guarded by a plethora of AI's who watch over the city-state, but who also roam the earth looking for humans to incorporate. The "Mother" prefers integrating children into the hive over adults, because it is easier to take control over the mind of a child than an adult. For this reason, most of Pantopia's residents are children, and adults are discarded a different way (still developing this side of the game). There will be different options the protagonist will go through that shed light onto its tasks and everyday life. But eventually, the protagonist will realize they also have a consciousness and the ability to integrate other beings into their own entity (also being a hive-mind). As the journey progresses, the main character will become more aware of their own consciousness and have to make decisions based on whether to continue the cycle planted by the "Mother" or do something radical.
