<h1> Gesamtkunstwerk in 2021</h1>

In theory, *Gesamtkunstwerk* can be created using **anything** and **everything**. The essense of *Gesamtkunstwerk* fundamentally lies within the message or purpose of the artist through the means of using multiple art forms. Aptly translating to "the total artwork", Wagner intended this artwork to: 
> "include all phases of art and in doing so to consume, to destroy each one, so to speak, in favor of the total purpose of them all" (Salter, 2010, p. 2).


In light our society's current technological advancements, there are numerous tools (either digital or physical) that could be used to create a *Gesamtkunstwerk*. 
One tool that comes to mind instantly is VR (virtual reality). Wagner's driving force behind creating *Gesamtkunstwerk* is for the audience to be completely immersed in the experience of the art. Using the technology available at the time, Wagner simulated this through creating a environment where he could manipulate the space. In this way, he could control the "illusion" he wanted his audience to experience. This included anything from the specifics of the auditorium and the architecture, to the acoustics, and even the lighting. The essentials of this immersive, multisensory art form is striving to create an experience using all/or multiple media. Not only can virtual reality manipulate the vision and space of its viewer, but it can be accompanied by specific acoustics. It can allow a viewer to feel "transported" and competely immersed into the virtual world that is created.


*Gesamtkunstwerk* can also be created using the various skills of artists with different expertise. Their disparate art forms can be unified in a manner to create a singular *Gesamtkunstwerk* experience. Though this isn't a physical tool, the collaboration between different artists and artistic mediums could enhance the "totality" or representation of the art tools being used. I assume that the creative processes, brain power, and intentions, of many artists collaborating together (whether that be architects, web designers, painters, scuplters, dancers, etc.) could be the means for a *Gesamtkunstwerk* performance. 

In my opinion, an example of *Gesamtkunstwerk* from the Rhizome Anthology is *386 DX* by Alexei Shulgin. Known as the world's first "cyberpunk band", its main singer is a Windows 3.1 PC playing MIDI files with a vintage sound card. *386 DX* has played all around the world, as the streets and anywhere it is placed becomes its stage. The live performance (not conducted by the PC) is assisted with colorful digital graphics, meant to emulate the early 90's. This work uses the multiple technological mediums, from the PC, vintage sound cards, and MIDI files, to create unique visual and auditory experiences for the viewer. Because of this, I believe it qualifies as a *Gesamtkunstwerk* to an extent.
