## Anna Anthropy: Videogames

Anna Anthropy critically analyzed many aspects of videogames, from the evolution of their creation, to the engineering and artistic elements, and those who're involved in this industry. But what Anthropy does best is highlight the exclusivity of videogames. Some examples in the reading are emulated through its lack of diverse representation, its homogeneous target audience and creators, and the exploitative costs for its consumption byway of capitalist practices. Despite these aspects, Anthropy also points out how the internet has been a great medium for videogames to be more accessible to people outside its focal niche, and how hobbyist and non-professionals can also create games. Ultimately, accessibility is a barrier in gaming and coding. And while there have been many efforts of improvements, and changes because of the internet, inequitable access is still an issue. 

Equitable accessibility in gaming and coding can truly be a game-changer, not only for videogames but for society as a whole. Inequity is an integral part of society, as neoliberal ideologies and capitalist values perpetuate socioeconomic stratification and commodify knowledge and information. So, the lack of representation and homogeneous demographics of this industry is not necessarily a 'videogame' problem, as much as it is a reflection of the world we inhabit. But, with increasing accessibility to skills surrounding gaming and coding, major improvements in videogames can be made. While there are many improvements that can be identified, two stand out in my mind. One improvement is the inclusivity of diverse perspectives and experiences, and the second is the promotion of creativity and innovation. 

There is so much to gain from a number of voices collaborating in creating videogames. But I think the biggest thing to gain, as mentioned by Anthropy, is the idea of being represented and included. An array of voices, opinions, and experiences, grants room for even more people to relate and participate. While entertainment and, to a degree escapism, may draw people towards playing videogames, the power of these digital games lies its interactive nature and the experience of being immersed in a different world with different systems of rules and goals. But most mainstream games are catered towards a very specific type of person (mostly men, and mostly white men). And while this demographic has somewhat became synonymous to this industry, and though there are a variety of videogames that cater to niches outside this demographic, there is still more improvement to be made. But other than inclusivity is the idea of creativity and innovation. Anthropy speaks about how types of videogames become cyclical because the populations consuming the products grow up to produce the same type of games. I once heard a quote by an unknown author who stated: 

> "What if the cure for cancer is in the abilities of a person who cannot afford an education?" 


Using a similar logic to this quote, new styles, designs, and systems for videogames may be in the abilities of a person who is unable to access or become familiar with videogames or the internet. And while the modern world has integrated technology heavily, this is not equal across the globe. I think an important part of access to coding and gaming is the limitless possibilities that can come from the minds of creative and innovative people. Without equitable access to these skills, there is a great disservice the coding and gaming industries bring upon themselves. But of course, profit supersedes fair opportunity. 

On another note, other kinds of media that can benefit from using 'game' creation tools is movies and digital artworks. I'm not sure why these came to my mind, but I believe movies/TV has already somewhat incorporated 'game' tools to an extent. There are movies and TV Shows, like Black Mirror's *Bandersnatch* that allows viewers to pick and choose how they want the story to unfold. I felt like *Bandersnatch* was done extremely well, as it did feel like I was both watching a show and playing a game. But 'game' creation tools can change for platform of how people consume both games and TV. Maybe in the future, the continual merging of these two mediums will produce its own type of media. Another type of media that may find some benefits is digital artworks or art made from digital softwares. I'm not sure how this could turn out, but I do think it could promote new styles and designs of videogames that are still yet to be discovered.
