## Nakamura and Digitized Race 

This week's reading really got my brain turning. At first it was overwhelming trying to understand the intersectionalities between the internet, neoliberalism, racism, gender, history, theories, and many other topics. However, Nakamura's citation of Lev Monvich's saying does a good job of encapsulating how and why racism has been digitized.

> "interactive media ask us to identify with someone elseâ€™s mental structure," (Nakamura, 2008, p. 16).

Nakamura analyzes this as,

> "[people] are interpellated into the 'new media designer's mental trajectory'," (Nakamura, 2008, p. 16).

Essentially, what Nakamura wants us to understand is that when we consume interactive media, we are consuming the hegemonic, systemic, and schematic belief systems and ideologies of whoever created that interactive media. Whatever mental processes, whether that be bias, racist, offensive, etc., that the creator took liberties on, would have to be *followed* (for lack of a better word) by the interactive media consumer in order to be consumed. That is why Nakamura stresses that further study should investigate how digital visual culture impacts networking, social spaces, and power relations in terms of race, ethnicity, and gender (Nakamura, 2008, p. 10). The power the media creator obtains greatly influences the minds and identities of the media consumers. It can pave ways for the media consumer to start thinking and behaving as the media creator does. Whether purposeful or not, this externality is detrimental. Racist and other discriminatory and harmful thought processes of the creator are be perpetuated throughout the internet, being cycled and followed forward.

One example of how tools like Gmail and Instagram are reflections of the designer's mental structure and identity is through the concept of "prioritizing". Gmail has multi-color star and tag systems to highlight important mail. There are also many tools and folders to organize emails. Maybe the creator of Gmail (Google) liked this style of organization; color-coded and highly symbolic. Maybe this organization style worked best for them, so they replicated it into the features Gmail now has. Now, everyone is subjected to use these types of tools when they want to organize or prioritize emails. It's unanimously accepted that *this* is the way it's done. But really, maybe this method of prioritization doesn't suit everybody. Similar with Instagram. There are verification symbols, the search page is algorithmically catered to each user, rampant comment sections, hearts for likes, and so many things. But why is it structured like this? What did the creator intend to prioritize with this platform, and what did they intend to minimize? Ultimately, the priorities that reflect the identities and mental structures of these media creators are, in a way, transferred over to the users. Through the medium of the internet, the identities and mental structures of users are hegemonized... as we have experienced and continue to do.
