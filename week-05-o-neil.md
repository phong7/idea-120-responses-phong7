## *Weapons of Math Destruction*: O'Neil Reading Response


O'Neil's *Weapons of Math Destruction* or WBD, provides very analytical and comprehensive insight into the repercussions and limitations to the Big Data Economy. Essentially, through mathematics and statistics, computer programs and software systems are able to sift through data and generate results according to its algorithm. However, this inevitably has various externalities, many of which have long-lasting impacts. O'Neil investigates this machine-programed model,  further exploring its social, economic, and political ramifications. O'Neil asserts:

> "the 3 elements of WBDs: <b> Opacity, Scale, and Damage </b>"

These models are *opaque*, in the sense that their intentions and standards are not clear. In some cases it's intentions are also unknown to whoever experiences to it. This lack of transparency is further inflated through the *scale* of which they are implemented. And ultimately, through its aftermaths inflicted in the lives of individuals communities, and the nation at large, *damage* is committed.


While "weapons of math destruction" is a clever play-on-words, it carries a deep heaviness as "weapons of mass destruction" does. Personally, Sarah Wysocki's story hits close to home. As a native-Chicagoan who attended Chicago Public Schools (CPS), I remember the countless standardized tests that students had to succumb to. During an end of the year exam, my 4th grade teacher told the class how some school teachers give answers to their students because they want higher test results. She shared this as part of the honor code. This is what Wysocki believes happened with her students. And she had a lot of evidence to back it up too. Standardized tests are a double-edged sword; not only was it evaluating students, but teachers as well.

An example of a WBD is CPS's tier system. Based within the realm of standardized tests, CPS's tier system is a localized damaging force. While a standard exam is given to all students, the score then gets categorized into four tiers. These tiers separate Chicago community areas by average income. The lower the tier, the lower the income of that neighborhood. The higher the tier, the higher the income. Students from lower tiers would need lower scores to place into selective enrollment schools, and vise versa. This was intended to diversify those schools and allow for a more equitable grounds of acceptances. But this lead to a plethora of issues. Many times, lower income neighborhoods corresponded to communities of color. It inevitably perpetuated institutionalized racism within the selective enrollment exams. It also brushed over all the nuances in income of every neighborhood resident. Furthermore, many students who were initially accepted into selective enrollment schools reportedly struggled to keep up with other students and student with high scores from higher tiers were rejected from schools they would've otherwise tested into. In short, there were too many problems with CPS's tier system.

As O'Niel describes:
> "the model itself contributes to a toxic cycle and sustains it"

The most terrible damage caused by WBDs is that it dehumanizes a person and reduces them to numbers. People are not numbers, people are not statistics. There is no question when it comes to numbers. But should it be that way? While numbers may not be seen as inherently complex, they are reduced to represent a complex, sentient human being. And with the ways this model functions, there is no capacity to incorporate the complexities of human life and experience. It's difficult to overcome WBDs because the model so intricately woven into our everyday lives. It's virtually inescapable, not only hear in the U.S. but across various nations. WBDs, as insinuated by O'Neil, isn't all terrible, but it's ramifications can be severe. It can and has delimited people and whole populations. It can have consequences that are hard to predict unless enforced. But the worst part is, it is fueled to sustain itself by cycling hegemonic and systemic oppression.
