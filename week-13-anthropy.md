## Anna Anthropy (Cont.): Chapter 3 & 4 Response

**1.) How exactly do folk games reflect cultures? Even if a game is authored, doesn't it still reflect the hegemonic cultures of the author? In this case, doesn't that still imply authored games can eventually become or are folk games?**
2.) Is there any follow up on Wrigstad's *Gang Rape* game? Has it to any extent, been effective in educating players about rape, assault, and other horrendous real-life experiences?
3.) Does the repurposing of commercial game assets contribute to video games having the same or similar format, storyline, plots, or nonlinear structure? Does this "standardize" and/or assimilate games to (for lack of better words) be the same types of games?

In Chapter 3's "The Rise of the Designer" section, Anthropy analyzes the differences between folk games and authored games. She differentiates the two by saying:
> "Folk games tell us about the culture that created them; authored games tell us about the author that created them."

The examples of folk games she provides include Tag, Chess, Go, and Hide and Seek to name a few. Folk games have been around since the beginning of civilization and have untraceable authors, and at times an unknown place of origin. Because of this, these games pose as artifacts shaped by various cultures and shed light onto certain aspects of those cultures. Anthropy uses the example of the chess and its European roots to reflect Viking warfare.

As Anthropy continues to distinguish between folk games and authored games in relation to video games. Authored games have the potential to be more personal, specific, and diverse, while folk games have the ability to change with its players that allows its longevity. But I want to know how exactly do folk games reflect cultures. It's clear how games like chess, gomoko, or yut nori are shaped by entire cultures, but how do games like Tag or Hide and Seek do the same? Unlike chess, the point of origin of Tag or Hide and Seek are unknown. These are also games my parents played when they were children, growing up on the other side of the world during the 60's. How can these types of "universal" games be cultural artifacts when its presence isn't specific to a particular region of the world or generation? Maybe Anthropy is purely looking at it from the perspective that they've been around for an extremely long time. But while I can understand how a game such as Chess was culturally derived and sheds light onto the cultures of influence, I do not see how this applies to other folk games - even if these games are immortalized in most societies.

Furthermore, though I understand how authored games differ from folk games, I wonder if authored games are still folk games - just with extra steps. Anthropy poses a question on how the remaking, the reformatting, and the various different authors involved in a game like *Snake* can potentially lead an authored game to become a folk game. And I think it was really smart of her to pose this as a question rather than an overt statement. But, every single person in this world has been enculturated by different cultures. Even if video game makers personalize their games or nonlinear structures, their creation is still a reflection of them and their cultures. The design of the game is still connected to the cultural and social impacts of the author. So I don't really see how authored games and folk games are separated from this perspective. They seem very intertwined. Maybe all games start off as authored games. And if the game is designed in a matter that makes it adaptability to each player and culture, maybe it can be considered a folk game in the future. In my opinion, it's rare for a video game or game to be void of reflecting the cultures that influenced its creation. Unless it's a game like Tag or Hide and Seek, most games, even games designed with specific rules and quirks, still reflect aspects of the author's culture. So, these games can also tell us about cultures and the times as well. Thus, where is the boundary regarding cultural influence in folk and authored games?
