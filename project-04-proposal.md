I would like to organize my portfolio with a basic homepage and  different links on the side to showcase my work. The first link will be IDEA 120, and I am considering adding US 304 and US 261 as well. The IDEA 120 tab will lead to a link showcasing Projects 1-3. US 304 will showcase my end of the year Portfolio I designed using Adobe softwares. I'm on the fence about US 261, but it's a GIS class with maps. The only reason I am thinking of including it is because the software allows us to tamper with how we want the map to look - and in this area (though quite limited) artistic freedom and the use of color theory and design are pertinent. In the last tab I would like to showcase some of my personal digital artworks.
