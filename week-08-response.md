## Chalabi & O'Neil: **Targeted Ads, Bad Stats, & The Internet**  

Chalabi and O'Neil analyze very important devises people are subject to when using tools and consuming media on the internet. Chalabi didn't explicitly speak about tools or media. However, she did highlight the growing distrust and inability to understand statistics, as well the simplicity to skew data in design and presentation. O'Neil, on the other hand, took a deep dive into the world of WBD and targeted advertisement. Primarily using the example of targeted ads for for-profit universities/colleges, O'Neil investigated how the most vulnerable and marginalized are targeted with false promises of upward social mobility. In turn, companies profit millions and the poor become poorer. Especially with the design of targeted ads, I believe I and every person whose ever connected to web, has been subjected to these models. Particularly when I was taking time off after high school, ads for DeVry University, University of Phoenix, Grand Canyon University, etc. etc. were *everywhere*. Even now, due to my love of techwear fashion, the entirety of my Facebook feed is bombarded by ads from clothing brands. Although the extent of nefariousness differs between targeted ads for fashion versus targeted ads for private loans, it is nearly impossible to escape the systems and algorithms of the internet.

The ideologies and practices behind targeted ads and misconstrued statistics is complicated. With the state of the internet at this point, it's *impossible* to create  egalitarian methods to overrule its current algorithms, targeted advertisements, infringement of privacy, etc. etc. Too many big companies will lose money. Too many powerful stakeholders are involved in schemes of the web and easily misconstrued stats and information. At this point, even *if* the internet could be more useful and egalitarian, this couldn't and wouldn't happen so there is no reason to hypothetically imagine how this would look. On the other hand, targeted ads and shaping interactions with specific designs is not *all* terrible. Such is the example with the bombardment of clothing ads on my facebook feed. Targeting people for things that pertain to them isn't necessarily evil. But, there must be boundaries. Recently I heard that McDonalds wants to take note of customers' license plates to remember their orders next time they come by. This is masked with the idea that it is for the customer, but really it's for the profit maximization (whether to sell more products or sell private information of consumers) of companies.

We will in a very complicated and interconnected world right now, whether that be online or in person. There are a plethora of institutionalized systems and virtual systems people are entrapped in and cannot escape. Understanding these systems to navigate and change them is difficult to do but must be done. Otherwise, unawareness and misunderstanding can lead to further socioeconomic and political stratification.
