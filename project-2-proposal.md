## Project 2 Proposal 

Due: 2/25/21 

These ideas will most likely change in some ways once I get started. But right now, I have two ideas: 1) do a zoom video of my cats fighting the apocalypse (using zoom green screen for the apocalypse scene), or 2) do a zoom video of multiple versions of myself. The capabilities of doing any of these ideas requires me getting use to Zoom's virtual backgrounds and knowing my own technological limitations. I have to get use to the softwares first to know what I can/cannot do. Once this is discovered, I will narrow down to one option.
