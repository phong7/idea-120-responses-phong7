## Murray's *Digital TV and the Emerging Formats of Cyberdrama*


After reading Murray's predictions and updated 2016 conclusions about internet television and inhabiting virtual environments, I believe she was more or less successful in her speculations. The bulk of this chapter explored Murray's four main predictions of the hypothetical future of *cyberdrama*, which can be defined as:

> "the coming digital story form... [that] will encompass many different formats and styles but will essentially be a single distinctive entity."

Her predictions include: **hyperserial sites** (where TV meets the internet), **mobile viewer movies**, **virtual places and fictional neighborhoods**, and **role-playing in an authored world**. In my opinion, each of these predictions are incredibly well-thought out, socially and intellectually insightful, and creative. I especially found her predictions on virtual places and fictional neighborhoods quite precise as there are many movies and games that inhabit virtual reality formats. While not all of her predictions were 100% accurate, many of them hold varying degrees of correctness. This is well outlined in her 2016 update section, where she also devises new predictions based on the current technological states of the TV, movie, and gaming realms. Overall, Murray's predictions were very insightful and though not all of it has occurred *yet*, there is always a possibility they may in the future.

In light of the hyper-realistic virtual environments byway of LED walls used in 'The Mandalorian', Murray's prediction of the virtual places and fictional neighborhood is somewhat manifested. Although viewers are not immersed in 'The Mandalorian''s hyper-realistic virtual environment, the actors during filming are. What ends up being filmed is *actual* recorded footage of actors in the virtual environments displayed by LED walls instead of traditional green screen backgrounds. In many ways, actors can now be immersed within their hyper-realistic worlds without the use of green screens or being there physically. Actors are able to experience dichotomic realities, one provided by virtual environment, and the other by the physical environments of the filming studio. For viewers on the other hand, it's a bit different. Viewers, while watching and being immersed in a TV series, movies, or games, will be watching those mediums and virtual reality simultaneously. In essence, they will be experiencing both the TV series's world and the virtual reality provided by the LED walls at the same time. It's an interesting phenomena as the boundaries between virtual reality and the physical world become merged and then consumed by viewers. Many different layers of realities will collide and become harder to distinguish. But this can also create a very new type of experience for actors and viewers in their immersion and interaction with the real and virtual worlds.
