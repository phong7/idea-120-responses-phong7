## McLuhan & Barthes: Media "Hot" & "Cold" and the Rhetoric of an Image

The concept of "hot" and "cold" media, especially in relation to social media and the internet, is fascinating to explore. Not only is there a large variance in how people consume the internet, there is also a lot of differentiation in how people will perceive and react to what they consume. In many cases, as pointed out in the lecture, due to the internet's various forms of participation and multiple forms of media, it tends to be "warm". It is in this "warm" area, click-bait Youtube thumbnails will be investigated.

As Barthes analyzes, there are three messages an image semiotically displays:
> "linguistic message, a coded iconic message, and a non-coded iconic message" (Barthes, 1999, p. 36).

A linguistic message is textual, an coded iconic message or symbolic message, is what is being signified through the image, and a non-coded iconic message or literal message, is the signifiers that indicates what is being signified. He further explains that signified and the symbolic image is what is being *connoted* while the literal signifiers of the image is being *denoted*.

To see an example of a click-bait Youtube thumbnail, [press this link](https://i.redd.it/2dxhy2g7ynu51.png). 

In the example of the click-bait Youtube thumbnail, the linguistic messages are the title of the video "Joe Biden is straight lying", and the enlarged caption "you won't believe what Joe Biden did". The denoted message of this image is Joe Biden with his fingers in front of his mouth, and the three emojis: &#129327;, &#128064;, and &#128561;.

To understand the connoted message, American cultural and political context is essential. The linguistic and denoted messages are quite vague when investigated individually. The linguistic message sets a stage for inquiry, as it states that Biden is "lying" but about what is unknown. The image of Biden himself shows that he is the main subject of interest, but overall his image and the emojis are decontextualized. But looking at the image holistically, and armed with the knowledge of immense sociopolitical tensions in the United States, the thumbnail's connoted message is very clear. Synthesized, this is a click-bait image to lure viewers into consuming a politically defamatory video of President Joe Biden. The arrow pointing to Biden's head is accusatory and the emojis clearly represent shock and terror to whatever he has "lied
 about.

Since this is a click-bait Youtube thumbnail, this image can be received differently if seen through another medium. If this was an thumbnail was shown on the app TikTok, there is no assurance of it being consumed to the extent it is on Youtube. While both TikTok and Youtube have algorithms to boost views, TikTok videos do not rely on thumbnails to relay videos. It is more so based on the popularity of videos and the subjects of personal "likes". Though Youtube is similar in those aspects, the thumbnail definitely has a larger role in the video being consumed. Of course there are nuances to both these platforms in their "hot" and "cold" aspects. However, in general this thumbnail wouldn't be as effective if not on the medium of Youtube. Because it is specifically designed for Youtube, this image cannot hold the same weight when showcased outside of Youtube's bubble. Furthermore, because context and choice are critical aspects to how an image is received, the thumbnail would also be consumed differently for someone unfamiliar with the American politics. It can also conjure strong emotions of anger towards those who hold differing political views, or glee and assurance for those with similar political stances.
